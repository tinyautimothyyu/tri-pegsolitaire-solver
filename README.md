# tri-pegsolitaire-solver
This is a personal programming project to solve the triangular peg solitaire board game.

## Introduction
This is a one-person game of peg solitaire on a triangular board with various size. In general, the size and the shape of the board are arbitrary. The peg solitaire on a triangular board with 15 holes was first popularized by Cracker Barrel restaurant. It is considered as "IQ test" for many people as it is suprisingly difficult to solve given its simple rules and size.

University's programming courses often use this problem as assignment. I am going to think about my strategy on my own then compare with other solutions available online. For more details, please see https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL11/Bell/bell2.pdf.
